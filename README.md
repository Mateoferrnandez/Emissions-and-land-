# Exploring the Relationship Between Forest Cover and CO2 Emissions in South America

## Overview

This is my first personal project, where I investigate the relationship between forest cover and CO2 emissions in South America. By analyzing data using pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I aim to understand how forest cover and land use impact CO2 emissions across various countries in the region. To enhance the visualization and comprehension of this relationship, a Power BI dashboard has also been created.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For conducting and documenting the analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the detailed analysis.
- `data/`: Directory for raw and processed data files.
-`asets/`: images used in the storytelling

## How to View the Project

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Open the notebook in the `notebooks/` directory to see the detailed analysis and conclusions.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: The dashboard can be viewed online on Deepnote.
