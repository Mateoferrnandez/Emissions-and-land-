# Exploring the Relationship Between Forest Cover and CO2 Emissions in South America

## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between forest cover and CO2 emissions in South America. By analyzing data using pandas and Jupyter Notebook, we aim to understand how forest cover and land use impact CO2 emissions across various countries in the region. To enhance the visualization and comprehension of this relationship, a Power BI dashboard has also been created.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For conducting and documenting the analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the detailed analysis.
- `data/`: Directory for raw and processed data files.
- `images/`: Folder for any images or plots generated during the analysis.
- `dashboard/`: Contains the Power BI dashboard files and a link to view it online.

## How to View the Project

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Open the notebook in the `notebooks/` directory to see the detailed analysis and conclusions.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: The dashboard can be viewed online on Deepnote. [View Dashboard on Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/your-dashboard-link)

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
